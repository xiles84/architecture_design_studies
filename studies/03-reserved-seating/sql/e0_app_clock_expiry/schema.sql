-- E0 — app-clock-expiry (NEGATIVE CONTROL): tables.
--
-- Byte-identical tables to S1. The single change is whose clock decides: every
-- now() in the design's logic -- the expiry written by a hold, the "has it expired?"
-- test in steals, reads, confirmations and the sweeper -- is replaced by $app_now,
-- a timestamp the application sends, read from the application server's clock.
--
-- Across real machines, application servers' clocks disagree by milliseconds to
-- seconds, occasionally far more. A server whose clock runs fast judges holds
-- expired before they are, and its buyers and its sweeper take seats that another
-- buyer was promised: theft, and a confirmation rejected minutes before expiry.
--
-- On one machine every container reads the same clock, so the skew is INJECTED:
-- the harness runs two simulated application nodes, one exact and one running
-- ahead, and the sweeper runs on the fast one. E0 is expected to show theft and
-- early rejections in the lifecycle experiment, and is reported as a failure if it
-- does not. It is not a measurement of how large real skew is.
--
-- Every statement still returns the database's now() AS db_now: the harness's
-- ledger, and audit.sql, judge the truth by the database clock.
