-- S2 — lock-then-update: tables.
--
-- Byte-identical tables to S1. The single change is in writes.sql: before taking
-- the block, the buyer locks its seat rows with
--
--   SELECT seat_id, <free?> FROM event_seat WHERE ... seat_id = ANY (block)
--    ORDER BY seat_id FOR UPDATE
--
-- checks in the application that every seat is free, and only then issues S1's
-- conditional UPDATE (which must now match every row: the rows are locked).
--
-- This is the pessimistic way to say "these seats are mine": lock, look, write.
-- Against S1 it costs a round trip and holds row locks across the check. What it
-- buys is a clear answer before writing, and deadlock freedom by construction:
-- ORDER BY runs before FOR UPDATE locks rows, so two buyers of overlapping blocks
-- always lock their common seats in the same order.
--
-- A buyer who reaches for a seat another buyer is taking WAITS for that buyer's
-- transaction. S3 changes exactly that.
