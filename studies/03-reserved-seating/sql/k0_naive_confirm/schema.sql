-- K0 — naive-confirm (NEGATIVE CONTROL): tables.
--
-- Byte-identical tables to S1. The two designs differ in one statement of
-- writes.sql, w_confirm_seats.
--
-- The buyer checked the hold before paying (w_check_hold, identical in both), so
-- after the payment the naive confirmation simply marks the block's seats sold:
--
--   UPDATE event_seat SET status = 'sold', hold_id = $hold WHERE ... seat_id = ANY (block)
--
-- That check was true when it ran. But payment takes minutes, and a hold can expire
-- during it. By the time the confirmation lands, another buyer may hold the seat,
-- or have bought it. The naive confirmation overwrites them: a sale after expiry,
-- and a second ticket for a seat that is already sold, or a hold stolen from a buyer
-- who was promised it. K0 is expected to show late sales in the lifecycle
-- experiment, and is reported as a failure if it does not.
--
-- S1's checked confirmation adds three conditions to that WHERE clause -- still
-- this hold, still held, still unexpired by now().
